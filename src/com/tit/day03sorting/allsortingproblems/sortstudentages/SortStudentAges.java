7. Counting Sort - Sort Student Ages
Problem Statement:
A school collects studentsâ€™ ages (ranging from 10 to 18) and wants them sorted. Implement Counting Sort for this task.
Hint:
Create a count array to store the frequency of each age.
Compute cumulative frequencies to determine positions.
Place elements in their correct positions in the output array.
