9. Circular Linked List: Online Ticket Reservation System
Problem Statement: Design an online ticket reservation system using a circular linked list, where each node represents a booked ticket. Each node will store the following information: Ticket ID, Customer Name, Movie Name, Seat Number, and Booking Time. Implement the following functionalities:
Add a new ticket reservation at the end of the circular list.
Remove a ticket by Ticket ID.
Display the current tickets in the list.
Search for a ticket by Customer Name or Movie Name.
Calculate the total number of booked tickets.

Hint:
Use a circular linked list to represent the ticket reservations, with the last nodeâ€™s next pointer pointing to the first node.
When removing a ticket, update the circular pointers accordingly.
For displaying all tickets, traverse the list starting from the first node, looping back after reaching the last node.
